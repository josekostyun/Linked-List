Pt II of Project

**The Meal, Second Course:**

At this point the Failcircles unwind into Failqueues, with the smallest-numbered Failfish from each Failcircle at the head of that Failcircle’s Failqueue.
* The Failfish converge on and consume the highest-numbered Failfish of those at the heads of the queues.
* In case of a tie, the Failfish at the head of the smallest-numbered Failgroup’s queue is eaten.
* This continues until there is only one Failfish remaining.
* You are to report which Failfish this is, based on the theory that this information will allow the farmer to breed Failfish that are less likely to be eaten.
  * (It will not.)
